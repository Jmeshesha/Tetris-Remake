<p>This is my implementation of the game Tetris using the Slick-2D and LWJGL libraries for graphics and the GSON library for saving and reading custom pieces.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p> You can download it from  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/zwp9i3jyn6pz07d/Tetris_Remake.rar/file">this link</a> or by downloading the repo and running the executable jar file in out/artifacts/TetrisRemake</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<h3>Game</h3>
<p><b>S Key:</b> Moves piece down and makes sure that the piece timer for moving down is reset (Can be held down)</p>
<p><b>D Key:</b> Moves piece right (Can be held down)</p>
<p><b>A Key:</b> Moves piece left (Can be held down)
<p><b>W Key:</b> Rotates piece about its rotation point if exists</p>
<p><b>Space Key:</b> Hard drops piece to end location</p>
<p><b>E Key:</b> Puts piece into hold position. If the hold position is already filled swap the current piece and hold piece</p>
<p><b>Escape Key:</b> Pause game</p>
<h3>Piece Creator</h3>
<p> There are 3 different modes that change what happends when you click on a block in the grid. You can toggle through these modes with the E key.</p>
<p><b> Mode 0:</b> Adds or removes a block from the grid</p>
<p><b> Mode 1:</b> Adds, changes, or removes the rotation point from the grid</p>
